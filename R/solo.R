#' solo: Sound localization in R.
#'
#' The solo package contains functions for localizing sounds using R.
#' Localizations are carried out using the modified steered response power
#' algorithm of Cobos et al. (2011) which carries out a grid-search to find
#' the location in three dimensions where a sound was most likely to have
#' originated.
