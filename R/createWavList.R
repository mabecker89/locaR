#' Create a list of Wave objects.
#'
#' This function reads in portions of a set of synchronized .wav files. It is intended to be used to load
#' sounds of interest for localization.
#'
#' @param paths Character vector. File paths to the set of .wav files to be read.
#' @param names Character vector. Station names for the files. Must have the same length and
#'     the names must occur in the same order as the \code{paths} variable.
#' @param from Numeric. Start time, in seconds, of the sound of interest, relative to
#'     the start of the file.
#' @param to Numeric. End time, in seconds, of the sound of interest, relative to
#'     the start of the file.
#' @param buffer Numeric. Amount of blank space around each sound of interest to be read.
#' @param adjustments Numeric vector. Amount, in seconds, to adjust the start times of recordings,
#'     if not already synchronized. Vector must be of the same length as the
#'     \code{paths} variable. If not specified, default is no adjustment.
#' @param channels Numeric vector. The channel to be read from each .wav file. Left = 1, Right = 2. If
#'     missing, default is left channel (channel 1) for all recordings.
#' @param index Numeric. If using this function within a loop, pass the index i to the function, which
#'     can help with troubleshooting if an error occurs.
#' @return Named list of Wave objects.
#' @export
